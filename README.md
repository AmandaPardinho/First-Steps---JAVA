## Cassava Portion

> Every year in April, the Curupira, Boitatá, the pink Boto (this one in his man form, as Dona Chica likes it better), 
> Mapinguari and Iara meet at Dona Chica to remember their moments with Mani, the beautiful girl with the white skin. 
> And as it could not be different the main dish of this meeting is the cassava. Each one of them eats one to ten 
> servings of cassava, and they always warn Dona. Chica in advance about how many servings they will eat that day. The 
> size of the portion of each is different, but they are always the same. The portions are as follows (in grams):
>
>* Curupira eats 300;
>* Boitatá eats 1500;
>* Boto eats 600;
>* Mapinguari eats 1000;
>* Iara eats 150.
>
> Dona chica in turn always eats 225 grams of cassava. Tired of every year having to figure out how much cassava to prepare she contacted you to write a program that tells how much cassava should be prepared in grams.
>
